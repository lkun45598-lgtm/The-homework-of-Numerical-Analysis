In recent years, with the emergence of advanced AI capabilities, the field of numerical methods for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) has increasingly moved towards integration with AI. This has led to the development of novel approaches such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving both forward and inverse problems.This has led to the development of novel approaches such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving both forward and inverse problems, as well as Operator Learning methods for rapidly solving entire classes of PDEs.
Our team is deeply invested in the AI + PDE domain and is keen to cultivate more research talent in this area. Through our exploration, we have found that the core of "AI for Scientific Computing" remains scientific computing itself. In other words, a strong foundation in traditional numerical methods for PDEs is a prerequisite for engaging in this research. Furthermore, proficiency in numerical methods for PDEs and other areas of computational mathematics relies on the fundamentals taught in Numerical Analysis.
