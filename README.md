# The-homework-of-Numerical-Analysis
In recent years, with the emergence of advanced AI capabilities, the field of numerical methods for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) has increasingly moved towards integration with AI. This has led to the development of novel approaches such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving both forward and inverse problems.This has led to the development of novel approaches such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving both forward and inverse problems, as well as Operator Learning methods for rapidly solving entire classes of PDEs.
Our team is deeply invested in the AI + PDE domain and is keen to cultivate more research talent in this area. Through our exploration, we have found that the core of "AI for Scientific Computing" remains scientific computing itself. In other words, a strong foundation in traditional numerical methods for PDEs is a prerequisite for engaging in this research. Furthermore, proficiency in numerical methods for PDEs and other areas of computational mathematics relies on the fundamentals taught in Numerical Analysis.
Note: A background solely in AI is insufficient to contribute to AI + PDE research. We must master traditional numerical methods for PDEs to understand their strengths and weaknesses. Only then can we determine if our novel models offer a genuine advantage over classical approaches. And before studying numerical solutions for PDEs, a foundational understanding of Numerical Analysis is essential.
The foundational principles of Numerical Analysis are critical for understanding modern techniques:
  The theory of solving systems of linear equations underpins the solution of matrix systems that arise from the discretization of numerical schemes like the Finite Difference method.
  Interpolation, approximation, numerical integration, and Fourier transforms are fundamental to solving for coefficients in methods like the Finite Element and Spectral methods.
  The methods for finding roots and fixed points of nonlinear systems are crucial for a deep understanding of optimization algorithms.
In essence, modern research in numerical PDEs cannot be detached from a background in traditional methods, which are themselves rooted in the fundamentals of Numerical Analysis.
#Seminar Goals
The objective of our Numerical Analysis seminar is, over a four-month period, to equip team members with fundamental knowledge of numerical analysis, a grasp of certain numerical methods for solving PDEs, and solid Python programming skills.
Upon completion, participants will be capable of both implementing classical numerical PDE examples and developing machine learning-based PDE solvers. The ultimate aim is for most members to develop the ability to comprehend and reproduce research literature (with a focus on neural network-based PDE solvers) by the summer. This will prepare them to participate in genuine research projects and achieve publications in the near future.
Note: Our seminar is a non-profit, community-driven initiative. On one hand, we aim to cultivate the next generation of talent in the AI + PDE field. On the other, we hope to promote the dissemination of knowledge and help students build a strong foundation in computational mathematics. Participants are free to join or leave at any time, but we expect full commitment and effort during your time with the group.
